# Run-length encoding

The run-length encoding or RLE is a lossless data compression algorithm. It
stores "runs" of data (a sequence in which a same value occurs any amount 
of consecutive times) in a single data value, and it's count.

The encoding is only useful when having data in which these "runs" of data 
occur.
