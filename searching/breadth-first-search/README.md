# Breath-First search

Breadth-first search is an algorithm that finds a search value in a tree. It 
starts at the root node and explores all the nodes at one depth before moving on
to a deeper layer. 

This algorithm finds the fastest route in a tree also when some paths have an
almost infinite length. In example a maze solving algorithm where some paths 
can take very long to find a solution.
