# Quick sort

Quicksort is an efficient in place sorting algorithm. It usually performs better
than merge sort and heap sort. It sorts by choosing range and a pivot point
The range is initially the entire list and the pivot point for example the last
element in the list. Then bring all the values which are smaller to one side, 
the other to the other side. If this done the same is done for the range and 
pivot point are reset to the left and right side and repeat.
