# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is an in place algorithm which iterates over the list of items 
and inserts each item at its place while it is sorting.

The performance of this algorithm varies between $O(n)$ and $O(n^2)$ where
$O(n)$ is on an already sorted list and $O(n^2)$ on a reverse sorted list.
